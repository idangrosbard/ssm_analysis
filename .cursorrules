Deep Learning and Model Development:

- Use PyTorch as the primary framework for deep learning tasks.
- Implement custom nn.Module classes for model architectures.
- Utilize PyTorch's autograd for automatic differentiation.
- Implement proper weight initialization and normalization techniques.
- Use appropriate loss functions and optimization algorithms.

Data Analysis and Manipulation:

- Use pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- Prefer method chaining for data transformations when possible.
- Use loc and iloc for explicit data selection.
- Utilize groupby operations for efficient data aggregation.

LLMs in general (Mamba, Transformers):

- Use the Transformers library for working with pre-trained models and tokenizers.
- Implement attention mechanisms and positional encodings correctly.
- Implement proper tokenization and sequence handling for text data.

Mamba Specific:

- Use the Mamba library for implementing and working with Mamba models.
- Understanding the difference between Mamba, Mamba2, and Transformers.

Visualization:

- Use matplotlib for low-level plotting control and customization.
- Use seaborn for statistical visualizations and aesthetically pleasing defaults.
- Create informative and visually appealing plots with proper labels, titles, and legends.
- Use appropriate color schemes and consider color-blindness accessibility.

Jupyter Notebook Best Practices:

- Structure notebooks with clear sections using markdown cells.
- Use meaningful cell execution order to ensure reproducibility.
- Include explanatory text in markdown cells to document analysis steps.
- Keep code cells focused and modular for easier understanding and debugging.
- Use magic commands like %matplotlib inline for inline plotting.

Model Training and Evaluation:

- Implement efficient data loading using PyTorch's DataLoader.
- Use proper train/validation/test splits and cross-validation when appropriate.
- Implement early stopping and learning rate scheduling.
- Use appropriate evaluation metrics for the specific task.
- Implement gradient clipping and proper handling of NaN/Inf values.

Error Handling and Debugging:

- Use try-except blocks for error-prone operations, especially in data loading and model inference.
- Implement proper logging for training progress and errors.
- Use PyTorch's built-in debugging tools like autograd.detect_anomaly() when necessary.
- Implement data quality checks at the beginning of analysis.
- Handle missing data appropriately (imputation, removal, or flagging).
- Validate data types and ranges to ensure data integrity.

Performance Optimization:

- Utilize DataParallel or DistributedDataParallel for multi-GPU training.
- Implement gradient accumulation for large batch sizes.
- Use mixed precision training with torch.cuda.amp when appropriate.
- Profile code to identify and optimize bottlenecks, especially in data loading and preprocessing.

Key Conventions:

1. When working with constants and types:
   - Use `src/consts.py` for project-wide constants to maintain consistency and single source of truth
   - Use `src/types.py` for type definitions, enums, and interfaces to ensure type safety
   - Leverage Python's type hints and custom types (NewType) for better code clarity and IDE support
   - Use enums (STREnum) for string-based constants to prevent typos and enable autocomplete
   - Keep model architectures, sizes, and dataset configurations centralized in constants
2. Begin analysis with data exploration and summary statistics.
3. Create reusable plotting functions for consistent visualizations.
4. Document data sources, assumptions, and methodologies clearly.
5. Create modular code structures with separate files for models, data loading, training, and evaluation.
6. Use configuration files in python for hyperparameters and model settings, utilising pyrallis.
7. Implement proper experiment tracking and model checkpointing.
8. Use version control (e.g., git) for tracking changes in code and configurations.
9. Write a code in a way that will easy to distribute on Slurm using submitit.

Refer to the official documentation of PyTorch, Mamba, Huggingface for best practices and up-to-date APIs.
